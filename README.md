# How to mark test as Passed or Failed in Java with Appium on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=appium-java-passfail)

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you may face a scenario where a test that you declared as fail in your local instance may turn out to be completed successfully at LambdaTest. Don't worry though! We understand how imperative it is to flag an app automation test as either "pass" or "fail" depending upon your testing requirement with respect to the validation of expected behaviour. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-java).

# Steps:

You can specify a test as passed or failed by Lambda hooks. The following is an example on how to set test result as passed or failed. If the code reaches exception, then it will be marked as failed, else as passed.

Below is the ```vanilla_android.java``` example shown:

```java
public class vanilla_android {
    public static String userName = System.getenv("LT_USERNAME") == null ? "LT_USERNAME"  //Add username here
            : System.getenv("LT_USERNAME");
    public static String accessKey = System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY") == null ? "LT_ACCESS_KEY" //Add accessKey here
            : System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY");

    private static AppiumDriver driver;

    public static void main(String args[]) throws MalformedURLException, InterruptedException {

        try {
            DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "Galaxy S20");
            capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion", "11");
            capabilities.setCapability("platformName", "Android");
            capabilities.setCapability("isRealMobile", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("app", "lt://"); //Enter your app url
            capabilities.setCapability("deviceOrientation", "PORTRAIT");
            capabilities.setCapability("build", "Java Vanilla - Android");
            capabilities.setCapability("name", "Sample Test Java");
            capabilities.setCapability("console", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("visual", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("devicelog", true);

            driver = new AppiumDriver(new URL("https://" +userName + ":" + accessKey + "@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub"), capabilities);

            MobileElement color = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/color"));
            color.click();

            MobileElement text = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/Text"));
            text.click();

            MobileElement toast = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/toast"));
            toast.click();

            MobileElement notification = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/notification"));
            notification.click();

            MobileElement geo = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/geoLocation"));
            geo.click();
            Thread.sleep(5000);

            MobileElement el3 = (MobileElement) driver.findElementByAccessibilityId("Home");
            MobileElement browser = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.AccessibilityId("Browser"));
            browser.click();

            MobileElement url = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/url"));
            url.sendKeys("https://www.lambdatest.com");
            MobileElement find = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/find"));
            find.click();

            //MARKING TEST AS PASSED
            ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("lambda-status=passed");

        } catch (AssertionError a) {
            //MARKING TEST AS FAILED
            ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("lambda-status=failed");
            a.printStackTrace();
            driver.quit();
        }
    }
}
```

## Executing The Test

Execute the following commands to install the required dependencies:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command:

Android:

```bash
mvn test -P android
```

iOS:

```bash
mvn test -P ios
```

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
