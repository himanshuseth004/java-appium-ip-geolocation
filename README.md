# How to change IP geographic location in Java with Appium on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=appium-java-geoLocation)

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you may face a scenario where you would like to simulate location of a specific country. You can easily do that by using the lambdatest capability "GeoLocation" and refer the 2-letter country code in the automation script. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-java).

# Steps:

The following is an example on how to set geoLocation in the capabilities. You can make the change in the ```vanilla_android.java``` and ```vanilla_ios.java``` file:

Below is the ```vanilla_android.java``` example shown:

```java
public class vanilla_android {
    public static String userName = System.getenv("LT_USERNAME") == null ? "LT_USERNAME"  //Add username here
            : System.getenv("LT_USERNAME");
    public static String accessKey = System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY") == null ? "LT_ACCESS_KEY" //Add accessKey here
            : System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY");

    private static AppiumDriver driver;

    public static void main(String args[]) throws MalformedURLException, InterruptedException {

        try {
            DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "Galaxy S20");
            capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion", "11");
            capabilities.setCapability("platformName", "Android");
            capabilities.setCapability("isRealMobile", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("app", "lt://"); //Enter your app url
            capabilities.setCapability("deviceOrientation", "PORTRAIT");
            capabilities.setCapability("build", "Java Vanilla - iOS");
            capabilities.setCapability("name", "Sample Test Java");
            capabilities.setCapability("console", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("network", false);
            capabilities.setCapability("visual", true);
            capabilities.setCapability("devicelog", true);
          
            //ADD GEOLOCATION BASED ON COUNTRY CODE
            capabilities.setCapability("geoLocation", "fr");

            driver = new AppiumDriver(new URL("https://" +userName + ":" + accessKey + "@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub"), capabilities);

            MobileElement color = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/color"));
            color.click();

            MobileElement text = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/Text"));
            text.click();

            MobileElement toast = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/toast"));
            toast.click();

            MobileElement notification = (MobileElement) driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/notification"));
            notification.click();
            
        } catch (AssertionError a) {
            ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("lambda-status=failed");
            a.printStackTrace();
            driver.quit();
        }
    }
}
```

##Executing The Test

Execute the following commands to install the required dependencies:

```mvn clean install```
The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command:

Android:

```bash
mvn test -P android
```

iOS:

```bash
mvn test -P ios
```

Info: Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the üîó LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard.




Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
